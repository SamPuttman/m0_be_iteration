# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

   - It is very good at seperating out individual elements when paired with if statements.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

   - I need to get used to the syntax of the each method. I will practice it by playing around with it in IRB.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this assignment?

   - I tried to use my intuition more than Google for this assignment - I played around a lot with arguments that follow the "." after the value. (example: .start_with?, .length)
